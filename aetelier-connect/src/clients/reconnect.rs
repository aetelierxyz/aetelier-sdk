//! Reconnection policy, error classification, and connection health monitoring.
//!
//! This module provides the building blocks for resilient WebSocket connections:
//!
//! - [`DisconnectReason`](crate::clients::disconnect::DisconnectReason) — a typed classification of *why* a connection ended,
//!   derived from WebSocket close frames, transport errors, or application-level
//!   signals (stale connection, receiver drop).
//!
//! - [`ReconnectPolicy`](crate::clients::reconnect::ReconnectPolicy) — a stateful backoff engine with **jittered exponential
//!   backoff**, a configurable **max-attempts** limit, and a three-state **circuit
//!   breaker** (`Closed → Open → HalfOpen → Closed`).
//!
//! - [`HealthMonitor`](crate::clients::reconnect::HealthMonitor) — stale-connection detection based on a per-exchange
//!   silence timeout.  Designed to slot into a `tokio::select!` loop via its
//!   `deadline()` method.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Connection ownership is layered:
//!
//! | Layer | Responsibility |
//! |-------|---------------|
//! | `WssClient::run()` | Single connection lifetime; returns a `DisconnectReason` on exit |
//! | Exchange client (`receive_data`) | Subscription, heartbeat, decode; delegates to `WssClient` |
//! | `MarketWorker` | Owns a `ReconnectPolicy`; consumes the reason and decides retry / give-up / circuit-open |
//!
//! # Jitter rationale
//!
//! Pure exponential backoff (`delay × 2`) causes **thundering-herd** spikes when
//! many workers disconnect simultaneously (e.g. exchange maintenance window).
//! Adding uniform random jitter spreads reconnection attempts:
//!
//! ```text
//! actual_delay = base_delay + rand(0 .. base_delay × jitter_factor)
//! ```
//!
//! With the default `jitter_factor = 0.5`, a 4 s base delay becomes a uniform
//! draw from `[4.0, 6.0)` seconds.
