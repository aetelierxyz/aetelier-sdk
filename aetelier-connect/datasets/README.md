# aetelier datasets

Small, real captures of exchange wire data — the reproducible ground truth the
test suite replays. Every file here is bytes an exchange actually sent (public
market data, no credentials), captured over the venue's real protocol, trimmed
to a snapshot-anchored window, and committed so anyone can reproduce the tests
against the exact same input.

## Why these exist

Hand-authored JSON that *mimics* a venue's wire format drifts from reality and
can't catch a real protocol change. These captures let the decoder/normalizer
tests assert against genuine frames instead — the input is real, and the
expected values are pinned from the captured frame, so the oracle stays exact.
The venue conformance suite (`tests/conformance.rs`) and the per-venue parsing
tests (`tests/sources/`) both read from here.

## Provenance

Captured live via `examples/capture_fixture` (which drives each adapter's real
`ProtocolHooks` — endpoint, subscribe frames, heartbeat, frame codec — the same
path the runtime uses) for the WSS streams, and the venues' REST endpoints for
the seed snapshots. Symbol is BTC-quoted per venue (Upbit is KRW-BTC;
Hyperliquid is the bare perp coin `BTC`). Captured 2026-07 across the venue
conformance cycles; hyperliquid captured 2026-08-05 (cycle #5).

The `books_*` captures (kraken, okx) carry real per-frame CRC32 checksums and
bless the checksum algorithms in `src/framework/checksum.rs`; the rest are
combined book+trade windows used for reconstruction and normalization.

## Regenerating a capture

```
cargo run --example capture_fixture -- <venue> <wire_symbol> <seconds> <out.jsonl>
```

Coinbase runs split sockets in production: the `coinbase` venue arg captures
the book socket (level2 + heartbeats, the sequence-tracked one) and
`coinbase-trades` captures the market_trades socket.

Binance's parity capture (REST snapshot + a depth/trade window whose
`lastUpdateId` lands inside the delta stream) has a dedicated helper:
`datasets/binance/capture.sh`.

Seed-alignment note: for sequence-seeded venues the seed must land *inside* the
captured delta window, or offline reconstruction can't bridge to it. KuCoin's
REST `level2_100` snapshot is fetched a few seconds into the WSS capture; HTX's
in-band REQ is sent mid-stream by the capture bin (at t≈6s) for the same reason.
Bitso is L3 (order-keyed, seeded 0-based), so its REST snapshot is
alignment-immune.
